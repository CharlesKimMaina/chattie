# Introduction

## Working in the final project

- Communication is key
  - Especially around interfaces
- Help each other as a group
- Talking about interfaces is important!

## Working with git in the final project

- You are responsible for the changes in your commits, so take on that responsibility!

## Expectations for getting the certificate

It is your responsibility to get code into the database.

## Coding in the final project

- Make smaller PR's (easier to review and to merge)
- Make sure you minimize your merge conflict possibility
  - Modularize _all_ your code. First thing you do is create a new file and start working in that (if it makes sense)
