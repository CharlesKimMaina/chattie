# Introduction

## What we be building (By Niels Schmidt)

## Working in the final project

The final project is run exactly like a real worlds project (maybe even a bit more professional)

It gives you as students a place to get comfortable with working professionally. But we also expect a lot from you.

- Communication is key
  - Especially around interfaces
- Help each other as a group
- Talking about interfaces is important!
  - Why we have swagger and proptypes

## Working with git

`git status` is your best friend!

- You are responsible for the changes in your commits, so take on that responsibility!
- Meaning look through all the changes you are making
- Avoid committing things that is not part of the task. (fx linting errors, weird line breaks, etc)
- Connect the issue with a PR: See an example here: https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/chattie/pull/37
- `develop` and `master`

## Expectations for getting the certificate

It is your responsibility to get code into the project. That does not just mean writing the code, but also

- Creating the PR
- Making sure that the PR gets reviewed
- Making sure updates are made when it gets reviewed
- The PR does not have merge conflicts
- The PR is merged

https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/chattie/blob/master/certificate.md

## Coding

- Make smaller PR's (easier to review and to merge)
- Make sure you minimize your merge conflict possibility
  - Modularize _all_ your code. First thing you do is create a new file and start working in that (if it makes sense)

## Working with stories

All stories (features) are [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/chattie/projects/1)

Make sure you truly understand the story you are about to work on. A lot of time should be spend understanding the story:

- Planning the architecture
- Talking with people that makes code involved to your feature
- Getting everything set up nicely with a new branch and linting working
- Asking questions

Its very important to put your stories in the relevant column in the project board. Benjamin will be using that to track ow the project is going and help people that are stuck.
