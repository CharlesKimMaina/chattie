# Introduction

## What we be building (By Niels Schmidt)

## Working in the final project

- Communication is key
  - Especially around interfaces
- Help each other as a group
- Talking about interfaces is important!
  - Why we have swagger and proptypes

## Working with git

- You are responsible for the changes in your commits, so take on that responsibility!

## Expectations for getting the certificate

It is your responsibility to get code into the database.

## Coding

- Make smaller PR's (easier to review and to merge)
- Make sure you minimize your merge conflict possibility
  - Modularize _all_ your code. First thing you do is create a new file and start working in that (if it makes sense)
  
## Working with stories

All stories (features) are [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/chattie/projects/1)

Make suer you truly understand the story you are about to work on. A lot of time should be spend understanding the story:
- Plannin the architecture
- Talking with people that makes code involved to your feature
- Getting everything set up nicely with a new branch and linting working
- Asking questions

Its very important to put your stories in the relevant column in the project board. Benjamin will be using that to track ow the project is going and help people that are stuck.
